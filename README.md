# dometyl
This is a library (currently under construction) for generation of paramaterized
dactyl-manuform/skeletyl inspired keyboards. Documentation will improve when
things are more stable, but if you want to play around with what exists so far,
you'll need to install my fork of scad_ml into your opam switch:

1. `git clone https://github.com/geoffder/scad-ml`
2. `cd scad-ml`
3. `opam install ./scad_ml.opam`

The other dependencies are `base` and `stdio` from janestreet, both of which are
available through the opam package manager.
