# Dometyl - Another Dactyl inspired keyboard (eventually supporting rubber domes)

## Overview
This is a library (currently under construction) for generation of paramaterized
"3d" split-hand, concave, columnar, ergonomic keyboards in the spirit of the
[Dactyl](https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard) written in
[clojure](https://clojure.org). **Dometyl** also takes inspiration from a
lineage of **Dactyl**-like keyboards that evolved from the original script,
including the [Compactyl](https://github.com/dereknheiley/dactyl-manuform-tight)
itself a fork of forks of dactyl-manumform keyboards with many accumulated
features, and the [Skeletyl](https://github.com/Bastardkb/Skeletyl), a sleak,
low-profile, open-case design built in
[Fusion360](https://www.autodesk.ca/en/products/fusion-360/overview).

The name **Dometyl** comes from my original mission of creating a dactyl/skeletyl*-like*
board that can be built with rubber dome switches like Topre (or Niz, whose top
switch housings are available to purchase). The planned switching mechanism using
magnets and cheap hall-effect sensors rather than the typical capacitive sensor
PCBs works as expected in hand (images and video of prototype assembly to come),
however a sturdy enough and relible mounting scheme for dome and sensor platform
to the bottom of the plate is yet to be worked out (WIP parts can be found in
the Niz module).

In the meantime, the generator works fine for Mx and Choc style switches, so I
am working to improve the documentation and make it a bit more user friendly so
that others can begin to tool around with it.


## Setup
This generator is written in the [ocaml](https://ocaml.org/) language, so you'll
need to get an environment set up, including the package manager [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/) and
the build system [dune](https://github.com/ocaml/dune).

### Installing Scad_ml
One day I may get to upstreaming my drammatic changes to
[scad-ml](https://github.com/namachan10777/scad-ml) and do the work to get the
library added to the **opam** repository, but for now, you'll need to clone and
locally install my fork.
1. `git clone https://github.com/geoffder/scad-ml`
2. `cd scad-ml`
3. `opam install ./scad_ml.opam`

### opam dependencies
The other dependencies are [base](https://github.com/janestreet/base) (standard
library replacement) and [stdio](https://github.com/janestreet/stdio) from
janestreet, both of which are available through the opam package manager.
* `opam install base stdio`

## Usage
Online documentation is available
[here](https://geoffder.github.io/dometyl-keyboard/dometyl/index.html), and will
be filling in over time.

Scads are generated by executing `main.ml` by running `dune exec @dometyl` from
the [dometyl](dometyl) project folder.
